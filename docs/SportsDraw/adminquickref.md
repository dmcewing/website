3. Click *Manage* in the Team tile
4. Refer [Teams](teams.md) for adding teams.

!!! Note

    Rather than removing teams, use the "Include in Draw" toggle to remove them
    from the draw.  This will remove them from future generated draws but will
    leave them as the current name, for the previous draws.  If you just rename
    the team (also valid if their name changes) then the name will change on all
    previous draws too.

!!! Note

    The cancel button won't show if you don't have permission to administrate 
    the module.

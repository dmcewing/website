# Generate / Regenerate Draw

Once the competition settings have been completed then the draw needs to be generated.  This option, available from all the usual spots, will
prompt for confirmation of the days that are going to be redrawn.

Clicking the blue generate button will initiate the process to recalculate the draw.

!!! Warning

    By default all the game time slots for the days greater than now, will be removed and regenerated with the current settings.

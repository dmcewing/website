# About

![Selfie](./assets/dm-small.jpg){ width=150 align=right }This site is a site for me to dump information I've gleaned, possibly in a blog style, maybe just as pages of information.  The point though is that all of it is written in Markdown with a notepad rather than using a massive third party editor. 

## Me
I'm a nearly 50 year old developer with over 25 years professional development experience mainly in Microsoft technologies.  Starting professionally with Visual Basic 6, but informally with QBasic in the DOS and Windows 3.11 era, I've carved a path through COM+ services backing Forms and ASP websites to ASP.NET with SOAP services and onward to the cloud with Azure functions and Web APIs.

### Family
I married my wife in 2009 and now have five kids, 4 boys and a girl, who are now somewhere between their secondary education and preschool education.

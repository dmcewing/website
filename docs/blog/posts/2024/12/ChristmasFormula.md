# Christmas Proof

Given:
$$
\tag{1} y = \frac{\ln(\frac{x}{m} - sa)}{r^{2}}
$$

Solve for:
$$
\tag{2} x = mas(christ + 1)
$$

Start with rearranging (1):
Multiply both sides by $r^2$
$$
(r^2)y = \ln(\frac{x}{m} - sa)
$$

Get rid of the $\ln()$ by using powers of $e$
$$
e^{rry} = \frac{x}{m} - as
$$

Now we can multiply all the terms by $m$
$$
me^{rry} = x - mas
$$

We can now substitute $x$ for (2):
$$
me^{rry} = mas(christ + 1) - mas
$$

Distribute $mas$ inside the brackets (simplify): 
$$
me^{rry} = mas \cdot christ + 1 \cdot mas - mas
\newline
me^{rry} = mas \cdot christ
$$

Threfore:

$$
\therefore me^{rry} = christmas
$$

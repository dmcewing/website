# The Conflict of Two Kingdoms

*Brent Douglas*

_16th February 2025_


Matt 11:7-12,13-15

Christianity is not sweet and gental, but there is violence in the Kingdom.

He is talking about a shift where John is preparing the way for Jesus to come, and the power of the Devil was to be dimished and ultimately disabled.

400 years between the testaments - where the speaking of God was silent... until *John*.

The Devil was now on the backfoot trying to recover what he has lost in our lives.

There is a plan of attack to get you back to the position you were in before you accepted Christ.  This is one violent battle.

You cannot afford to be passive about this.

## Levels of Violence:

### 1. To get us back to where we were.

1Co 10:12-13 - No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man' and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the tempatation will provide the way of escape.

John 14:16-18 - The Holy Spirit will be with you and will not leave you as orphans.  H.S. is *IN* us not just with us.  That is why every believer must develop intimacy with the Holy Spirit.

See _How to move in the Holy Spirit. - Brent Douglas_.

2Co 13:14 - ARE YOU HAVING FELLOWSHIP WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT?

1Co 16:19

#### Result
John 16:13, 8:31-32  --- It is the truth that sets you free.

Memorizing the Bible is not enough, while truth, it is the principles behind those verses that God is really saying.

The Spirit of Truth reveals what God is saying behind the scriptures.

It is hearing the Word behind these words that generates faith.

Eph 1:18-19 
Rom 10:17 - So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.

Pray --> Hearing --> Faith

So now pray again with confidence with the Faith you have received.

This is all there to stop the Devil taking us back to where we were.

### 2. Activation of Personal Conflicts

There are two kingdoms that are in contention for your heart.

Gal 5:16-21  
    But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the 
    flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against 
    the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do 
    the things... 

Gal 5:22-25 But the fruit of the spirit....

Gal 5:17 (GNB) 
    For what our human nature wants is opposed to what the Spirit wants, and what the 
    Spirit wants is opposed to what our human nature wants.  These two are...

There is a war not only from the Devil but you fighting to adapt to the Fruit of the Spirit and not react/behave/do things how you used to do them... *This means war*.

Rom 7:15
    For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would 
    like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.

Gal 5:25
    (But,) If we live by the Spirit, we will walk by the Spirit, and not fulfil the lusts of the Spirit.

Truth comes and Faith is birthed.  But walk by the Spirit.

There is a case to just be _there_ with someone.

You need to stop applying the Devil and start applying the Bible and the power it has.
This isn't hard, just walk by the Spirit and you will not fulfil the lust of the flesh.

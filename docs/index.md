Welcome to David's Notes and Stuff a site where I just dump stuff.  Like 
a blog, but simpler and not as often populated.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-shield-account: &nbsp; __[The Blog](blog/index.md)__

    ---

    This is where the main content of the site resides.  Categorized into 
    categories to make it easier to find what I want, but don't expect to
    find what you are looking for.

-   :material-connection: &nbsp; __[About Me](about.md)__

    Just a few notes about me and how to get in contact etc.
